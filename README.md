## Technology

1. Node.js :

Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.

A Node.js app is run in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request.

Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking.

2. Sequelize:  
Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server. It features solid transaction support, relations, eager and lazy loading, read replication and more.

3. MySQL:  
MySQL is a freely available open source Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) that uses Structured Query Language (SQL). SQL is the most popular language for adding, accessing and managing content in a database. It is most noted for its quick processing, proven reliability, ease and flexibility of use.
